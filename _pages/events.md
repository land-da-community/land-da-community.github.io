## *Upcoming*

>## 5th Annual Land DA Community Virtual Workshop
>
>**Dates:** <br>
>October 27-28, 2025, Virtual <br><br>
>**Time:** <br>
>Two live sessions will take place each day from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) and another from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM China Standard Time (CST).<br><br>
>**About:**
>Technical challenges are the focus of this annual meeting as the scientific questions that lie behind those technical developments are typically the focus of other professional meetings and conferences. To strengthen communication between modeling groups, this workshop will bring together land DA scientists to highlight a range of DA methods used within the community, discuss challenges facing different modeling communities, and identify strategies for addressing those challenges. We welcome participation from a broad range of research interests including land surface states and fluxes (carbon, energy, and water cycles to crop, fire, and land management), timescales (daily, seasonal to subseasonal, centennial/millennial), and scientific and practical applications (improving understanding of carbon-climate feedbacks, weather prediction, agricultural forecasting, and climate change impacts). This workshop continues to foster knowledge exchange and promote the routine use of DA tools in the wider modeling community. We seek to strengthen connections between land DA communities to tackle technical challenges and build a collaborative land DA community inclusive of all backgrounds and career stages. <br><br>
>**Call for Abstracts:**
>We invite abstracts for talks that focus on the technical challenges of developing land data assimilation systems. Submit your abstract [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2AH4u2jrIK75PWkGZM8t0-EBxEW5lhMV-7AvHg1n2ldpRzg/viewform). <br><br>
>**Deadline:**
>**The abstract submission deadline is Friday, September 5.** If you experience any issues with the Google Form, you can submit your abstract via email to aimes[at]futureearth.org. <br>
