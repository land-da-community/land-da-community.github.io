### 4th Annual Land Data Assimilation Community Virtual Workshop: Recent Technical Developments in Land Data Assimilation, 24th-25th June 2024 1am-1pm EDT, Online 
[Register](https://aimesproject.org/land_da_workshop_2024/)

>**When:** Monday 24th June 2024 to 25th June 2024, 10:00-13:00 EDT // 17:00-19:00 CEST
>
>**Organizers:** Andy Fox (NASA GSFC, USA), Jana Kolassa (NASA GSFC, USA), Natasha MacBean (Western University, Canada), Tristan Quaife (University of Reading, UK), Hannah Liddy (AIMES, Columbia University, USA)
>
>**Overview:** Technical challenges are the focus of this annual meeting as the scientific questions that lie behind those technical developments are typically the focus of other professional meetings and conferences. To strengthen communication between modeling groups, this workshop will bring together land DA scientists to highlight a range of DA methods used within the community, discuss challenges facing different modeling communities, and identify strategies for addressing those challenges. We welcome participation from a broad range of research interests including land surface states and fluxes (carbon, energy, and water cycles to crop, fire, and land management), timescales (daily, seasonal to subseasonal, centennial/millennial), and scientific and practical applications (improving understanding of carbon-climate feedbacks, weather prediction, agricultural forecasting, and climate change impacts). The outcome of this workshop is to increase collaboration and coordination within the land DA community to tackle technical challenges and promote the routine use of DA tools in the wider modeling community. We seek to strengthen connections between land DA communities, increase knowledge exchange to tackle land DA challenges, and build a collaborative land DA community inclusive of all backgrounds and career stages. To learn more about the outcomes of previous workshops, please check out the Past Events section below.

>**Format:** This meeting will take place virtually, but we will facilitate interactions through discussion on zoom and via GitHub discussions on the Land DA Community GitHub site [here](https://github.com/land-da-community/2024-developments-in-land-DA-workshop/discussions) in addition to talks. 
>

>**Open Registration and Call for Posters:** We invite you to register and submit an abstract [here](https://aimesproject.org/land_da_workshop_2024/). 
>

>We are looking forward to continuing to build the Land DA Community! And we strongly encourage participation from early career researchers!
